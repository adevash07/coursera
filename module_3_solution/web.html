  processes (Herawatiet al., 2000). Environmental contamination by heavy metals has become a world-wide problem during recent years due to the fact that heavy metals 
  unlike some other pollutants are not biodegradable (Bazrafshanet al., 2015).Consequently, they are not detoxified but are bioaccumulated in the environment. 
Heavy metal refers to any metallic element whose density is relatively high and is toxic or poisonous even at low concentration (Inobemeet al., 2014).
